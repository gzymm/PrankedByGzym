PrankedByGzym Repo contains all my randoms "fake viruses" that i've made when i was 12 to prank my friends or just for fun. They were inspired from the Twitch Booster real virus from the 18-25 forum that attacked streamers in the past making them run the real malware
which had the effect of completely corrupt the MBR partition and make Windows unbootable.
 
It was originally named "GETOILE" and then i've started to make some derivatives;

GETOILE : The original fake virus that i've made using Batch and VBScript and some randoms .exe for effects such as Melting.exe

issou : Same as GETOILE but made specially for the Issous Risitas meme that "Twitch Booster" originally was from.

mrbeast : Also same as issou but made specially for the MrBeast from ohio meme. ⚠️ This one is really malicious since it completely corrupt the MBR partition.

mrbeast_safe : Exactly the same as mrbeast but without the malicious part such as the MBR corrupter.
